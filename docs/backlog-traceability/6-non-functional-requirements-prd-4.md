# 6. Non-Functional Requirements (PRD §4)
- **Performance (P95 latency < 2s)** → Linked to performance criteria across all CRUD + transactional stories (Stories 2–6, 7–9, 22–23, 26–27, 30–31)
- **Reliability (rollback bulk)** → Story 13 (Permissions & Safety)
- **Security (RBAC, confirmation)** → Stories 7–9, 13, 19, 23, 26, 30–31
- **Audit logging** → Implied across all stories; validated in architecture & test strategy
- **Usability (consistent syntax, clear errors)** → Applied globally across all stories
