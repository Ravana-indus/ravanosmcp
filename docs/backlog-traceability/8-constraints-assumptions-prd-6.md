# 8. Constraints & Assumptions (PRD §6)
- **Containerized deployment (Docker)** → Implementation constraint (not mapped to story)
- **Redis for caching/rate limits** → Implicit infra dependency, covered in architecture not stories
- **Confirmation prompts** → Stories 7–9, 13, 19, 23, 26, 30–31
- **Redacted logging** → Global requirement; tied to Story 13 (Permissions & Safety)
