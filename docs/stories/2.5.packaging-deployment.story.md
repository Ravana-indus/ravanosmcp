# Story 2.5: Final Packaging & Deployment

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** system administrator,
**I want** a production-ready MCP server package with deployment automation,
**so that** I can easily deploy and maintain the ERPNext Agent in production environments.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. NPM package configuration works with proper metadata, dependencies, and entry points
2. Docker containerization works with multi-stage builds and production optimizations
3. Configuration management works with environment variables and validation
4. Production logging and monitoring works with structured output and health checks
5. Deployment documentation works with installation guides and troubleshooting

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Stories 2.1-2.4 complete the domain packs (HR, Sales, Purchase, Inventory, Finance) building on the Core Spine foundation (1.1-1.13). All MCP tools are implemented and tested. Final packaging prepares the complete solution for production deployment.

### Package Configuration
**NPM Package Structure** [Source: architecture/11-developer-experience-project-layout.md]:
- Entry point: `dist/mcp/server.js` (compiled TypeScript)
- Binary: `erpnext-mcp-server` command
- Dependencies: @modelcontextprotocol/sdk, axios, winston, redis
- DevDependencies: typescript, jest, eslint, @types packages
- Scripts: build (tsc), test (jest), lint (eslint), start (node dist/mcp/server.js)

### Docker Configuration
**Container Structure** [Source: architecture/8-deployment-topology.md]:
- Base image: node:18-alpine for security and size
- Multi-stage build: build stage (with dev dependencies) + runtime stage (production only)
- Non-root user execution for security
- Health check: HTTP endpoint responding with MCP server status
- Environment: NODE_ENV=production, proper signal handling

### Environment Variables
**Configuration Schema** [Source: architecture/9-configuration-env.md]:
- Required: ERPNEXT_BASE_URL, ERPNEXT_API_KEY, ERPNEXT_API_SECRET
- Optional: REDIS_URL, LOG_LEVEL, PORT, HEALTH_CHECK_PORT
- Validation: URL format validation, API key format validation
- Secrets: API credentials must not be logged or exposed

### Observability Requirements
**Production Monitoring** [Source: architecture/7-observability-audit.md]:
- Structured logging: JSON format with timestamp, level, service, message
- Health endpoints: /health (basic), /health/ready (dependencies check)
- Metrics: Request count, response time histograms, error rates by tool
- Log levels: ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG (configurable via LOG_LEVEL)
- Audit logging: All tool calls logged with sanitized parameters

### File Locations
**Based on project structure** [Source: architecture/11-developer-experience-project-layout.md]:
- Docker files: `docker/Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`
- Config files: `.env.example`, `.env.production.example`
- Documentation: `docs/deployment/`, `docs/installation/`
- Build scripts: `scripts/build.sh`, `scripts/docker-build.sh`
- Entry point: `src/mcp/server.ts` → `dist/mcp/server.js`

### Testing Requirements
**Following testing strategy** [Source: architecture/12-testing-strategy.md]:
- Integration tests: Full MCP server startup and tool registration
- Container tests: Docker build, health check, and startup validation
- Configuration tests: Environment variable validation and error handling
- Performance tests: Load testing with k6 for production readiness
- Security tests: Credential handling and log sanitization

### Technical Constraints
- Package must be publishable to NPM registry
- Container must follow security best practices (non-root, minimal attack surface)
- Configuration must be 12-factor compliant (environment variables)
- Logging must not expose sensitive data (API keys, personal data)
- Health checks must validate actual service functionality, not just process existence
- Documentation must be complete for production deployment

### Security Requirements
**Production Security** [Source: architecture/5-security-rbac.md]:
- API credentials stored as environment variables, never in code
- Log sanitization for sensitive data (credentials, PII)
- Container runs as non-root user
- Network security: Only expose necessary ports
- Regular security updates for base images and dependencies

## Testing

### Testing Standards
**Test file location**: test/integration/, test/docker/
**Test standards**: Jest for integration tests, shell scripts for Docker tests
**Testing frameworks**: Follow existing patterns, add container testing with Docker
**Specific requirements**: Test full server startup, validate all tools register correctly, test Docker health checks, validate configuration loading
