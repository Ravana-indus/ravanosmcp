# Story 1.6: CRUD – Delete Document

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** delete a document,
**so that** I can remove obsolete records.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Valid doc deletes
2. Protected docs → `{code: "DELETE_NOT_ALLOWED"}`

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Implement erp.doc.delete tool (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Subtask 1.1: Add delete function to src/core/crud.ts
  - [ ] Subtask 1.2: Implement delete function with doctype, name parameters
  - [ ] Subtask 1.3: Add document protection validation logic
  - [ ] Subtask 1.4: Return success response for valid deletions
  - [ ] Subtask 1.5: Return DELETE_NOT_ALLOWED error for protected documents
- [ ] Task 2: Enhance ERPNext REST API integration (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Subtask 2.1: Add document deletion endpoint to erpnext_client.ts
  - [ ] Subtask 2.2: Handle deletion protection checks
  - [ ] Subtask 2.3: Implement proper error mapping for protected documents
  - [ ] Subtask 2.4: Add response logging with PII scrubbing
- [ ] Task 3: Register doc.delete tool in MCP (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Subtask 3.1: Update src/mcp/register_tools.ts to include doc.delete tool
  - [ ] Subtask 3.2: Create JSON schemas for doc.delete tool inputs/outputs
  - [ ] Subtask 3.3: Test tool registration and schema validation
- [ ] Task 4: Add unit tests (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Subtask 4.1: Add tests to test/crud.test.ts
  - [ ] Subtask 4.2: Write tests for successful document deletions
  - [ ] Subtask 4.3: Write tests for protected document scenarios
  - [ ] Subtask 4.4: Write tests for error handling

## Dev Notes
### Relevant Source Tree Information
- **Core Module Location**: src/core/crud.ts [Source: architecture/11-developer-experience-project-layout.md#2.1]
- **Adapter Location**: src/adapters/erpnext_client.ts [Source: architecture/11-developer-experience-project-layout.md#2.1]
- **Tool Registration**: src/mcp/register_tools.ts [Source: architecture/11-developer-experience-project-layout.md#2.1]
- **Test Location**: test/crud.test.ts [Source: architecture/11-developer-experience-project-layout.md#12]

### Technical Implementation Details
- **Framework**: MCP SDK [Source: architecture/2-components-responsibilities.md#2.1]
- **Error Handling**: Use canonical error format `{code: "DELETE_NOT_ALLOWED"}` [Source: architecture/4-error-model-result-envelope.md#Common codes]
- **Response Format**: Follow standard envelope with requestId, tool, ok, data, meta [Source: architecture/4-error-model-result-envelope.md#Envelope]
- **Transport**: HTTPS to ERPNext; TLS verification required [Source: architecture/5-security-rbac.md#Transport]

### Tool Specifications
- **erp.doc.delete**: `{ doctype, name } → { ok }` [Source: architecture/3-tool-namespaces-schemas-mcp.md#3.1]

### Security Considerations
- **PII Scrubbing**: Logs redact tokens, salaries, card data; configurable field allow/deny lists [Source: architecture/5-security-rbac.md#PII Scrubbing]
- **RBAC**: Evaluate via `erp.permissions.check` before deleting documents [Source: architecture/5-security-rbac.md#RBAC]
- **Sensitive Ops**: Require `confirm: true` flag for delete operations [Source: architecture/5-security-rbac.md#Sensitive Ops]

### Testing
- **Test Standards**: Follow testing strategy from architecture docs [Source: architecture/12-testing-strategy.md]
- **Test Types**: Unit tests for CRUD functions; integration tests against mock ERPNext responses
- **Test Coverage**: Cover success scenarios, protected document scenarios, and error handling
