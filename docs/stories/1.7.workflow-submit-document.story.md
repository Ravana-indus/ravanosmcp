# Story 1.7: Workflow – Submit Document

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** submit a document,
**so that** I can move it to the next workflow state.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Allowed per workflow
2. Unauthorized → `{code: "PERMISSION_DENIED"}`

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Implement erp.doc.submit tool (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Subtask 1.1: Create workflow.ts in src/core/ directory
  - [ ] Subtask 1.2: Implement submit function with doctype, name parameters
  - [ ] Subtask 1.3: Add workflow permission validation logic
  - [ ] Subtask 1.4: Return success response for authorized submissions
  - [ ] Subtask 1.5: Return PERMISSION_DENIED error for unauthorized submissions
- [ ] Task 2: Integrate with ERPNext workflow API (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Subtask 2.1: Add workflow submission endpoint to erpnext_client.ts
  - [ ] Subtask 2.2: Handle workflow state transitions
  - [ ] Subtask 2.3: Implement permission checks against ERPNext workflow rules
  - [ ] Subtask 2.4: Add response logging with PII scrubbing
- [ ] Task 3: Register doc.submit tool in MCP (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Subtask 3.1: Update src/mcp/register_tools.ts to include doc.submit tool
  - [ ] Subtask 3.2: Create JSON schemas for doc.submit tool inputs/outputs
  - [ ] Subtask 3.3: Test tool registration and schema validation
- [ ] Task 4: Add unit tests (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Subtask 4.1: Create test/workflow.test.ts
  - [ ] Subtask 4.2: Write tests for successful document submissions
  - [ ] Subtask 4.3: Write tests for permission denied scenarios
  - [ ] Subtask 4.4: Write tests for workflow state transitions

## Dev Notes
### Relevant Source Tree Information
- **Core Module Location**: src/core/workflow.ts [Source: architecture/11-developer-experience-project-layout.md#2.1]
- **Adapter Location**: src/adapters/erpnext_client.ts [Source: architecture/11-developer-experience-project-layout.md#2.1]
- **Tool Registration**: src/mcp/register_tools.ts [Source: architecture/11-developer-experience-project-layout.md#2.1]
- **Test Location**: test/workflow.test.ts [Source: architecture/11-developer-experience-project-layout.md#12]

### Technical Implementation Details
- **Framework**: MCP SDK [Source: architecture/2-components-responsibilities.md#2.1]
- **Error Handling**: Use canonical error format `{code: "PERMISSION_DENIED"}` [Source: architecture/4-error-model-result-envelope.md#Common codes]
- **Response Format**: Follow standard envelope with requestId, tool, ok, data, meta [Source: architecture/4-error-model-result-envelope.md#Envelope]
- **Transport**: HTTPS to ERPNext; TLS verification required [Source: architecture/5-security-rbac.md#Transport]

### Tool Specifications
- **erp.doc.submit**: `{ doctype, name } → { ok }` [Source: architecture/3-tool-namespaces-schemas-mcp.md#3.1]

### Security Considerations
- **PII Scrubbing**: Logs redact tokens, salaries, card data; configurable field allow/deny lists [Source: architecture/5-security-rbac.md#PII Scrubbing]
- **RBAC**: Evaluate via `erp.permissions.check` before submitting documents [Source: architecture/5-security-rbac.md#RBAC]

### Testing
- **Test Standards**: Follow testing strategy from architecture docs [Source: architecture/12-testing-strategy.md]
- **Test Types**: Unit tests for workflow functions; integration tests against mock ERPNext responses
- **Test Coverage**: Cover success scenarios, permission scenarios, and workflow state transitions
