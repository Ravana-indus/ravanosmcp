## Quick Security Commands

### Check File Permissions
```bash
# Configuration files should be 600 (owner read/write only)
ls -la .env*
chmod 600 .env

# Log files should be 640 (owner read/write, group read)
ls -la *.log
chmod 640 *.log
```

### Test SSL Configuration
```bash
# Test ERPNext SSL configuration
openssl s_client -connect your-erpnext.com:443 -servername your-erpnext.com

# Check certificate expiration
curl -vI https://your-erpnext.com 2>&1 | grep -i expire
```

### Monitor Security Logs
```bash
# Monitor failed authentication attempts
grep "Authentication failed" *.log

# Monitor suspicious API calls
grep -E "(DELETE|DROP|UPDATE.*SET)" *.log

# Check for rate limiting triggers
grep "Rate limit exceeded" *.log
```

### Validate Configuration Security
```bash
# Check for exposed secrets
grep -r "password\|secret\|key" . --exclude-dir=node_modules

# Verify environment variable usage
grep -r "process.env" src/

# Check for debug code
grep -r "console.log\|debugger" src/
```
